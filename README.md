*RESPONSIVE SCREENSHOT TBC

## USER EXPERIENCE:

### Who will use the website?

**Existing fans of the band (A)**

Goals:
- Find out about upcoming gigs;
- Listen to music; 
- Stay on top of the latest news from the band.



**Potential fans of the band (B)**

Goals:
- Find out more about the band;
- Listen to music;
- Sign up to keep in touch. 



**The band themselves (C)**

Goals:
- Increase sales of music;
- Increase streams of their music; 
- Increase attendance at their gigs;
- Get booked for more gigs by promoters;
- Increase press coverage.



**Promoters and people working in the music industry (D)**

Goals:
- Access information about the band quickly and easily (they are doing this in work, when they are likely to be busy rather than at leisure like fans);
- Listen to the band’s music; 
- Access photos which can be used in articles;
- Find contact information. 



## STRATEGY PLANE:

**Project Purpose:**

- Increase number of gigs and attendance at gigs:
    - **Strategy:** I will do this by ensuring that information about booked gigs and details of how to buy tickets are easily available to fans visiting the site and that contact details for booking gigs are clear and visible for promoters looking to book the band for gigs. We will also use a newsletter sign up form to enable fans and potential new fans to be updated whenever new gigs are announced.

- Increase sales and streams of music:
    - **Strategy:** The website will provide a clear path to streaming and buying the band’s music. A dedicated ‘music’ page will display clear visuals of the band’s albums. The album covers will serve as links to stream or purchase the albums. Giving the album covers dedicated, uncluttered attention will enhancing recognition of the album covers, which can help with physical sales in bricks and mortar shops separately from the website. 

- Increase press coverage/radio plays:
    - **Stategy:** Ensure that Electronic Press Kit (EPK) is easily accessible direct from the website so that promoters and music industry professionals can instantly access it without having to get in touch with the band/management and wait for a response. This reduces the likelihood that they will navigate away from the site without taking action. I will ensure that direct email contact details are easy to find. Providing email addresses as well as an email/message submission form adds a back up in case of any problems using the message submission form, and may also be preferable for people getting in touch in their professional capacity as they will have a record of their sent message if they send it from their own email account. 

- Increase engagement with fans and build a sense of community:
    - **Strategy:** The band’s social media profiles will be linked to in the website and these links will be visible on every page to increase the chance of them being clicked on. They will open in new tabs to reduce the risk of fans navigating away from the site and not returning to it. We will also promote the band’s newsletter on the website to enable the band to make repeated contact with fans who opt in and develop a relationship.

NOT INCLUDED

Merch shop:
Importance:	3 Viability: 2

I have chosen not to include a merchandise shop in this incarnation of the project as I do not currently have the skills to execute this feature. Furthermore, the band already benefits from a basic merch shop on Bandcamp, so this was not deemed to be a high importance feature at this time.



## SCOPE PLANE:

The website will include the following features: 

-	Navbar featuring a prominent band logo which functions as an additional link to the homepage. The navbar will be responsive and on smaller screens will move from the top of the page to the left and change to a hamburger menu. 

-	Icon-bar will serve as a footer on smaller screens and will move to be vertically aligned with the right side of the page on larger screens. This will include icons linking to the band’s social media accounts. This will ensure that the social media links are always visible without compromising the look and usability of the page and it is hoped that this will help the band to gain more followers on social media. Social media links will all open in new tabs to avoid moving people away from the site. 

-	A hero image of the band will be included on the home page to provide a striking first impression of the website and to reassure users that they are in the correct place. 

-	A hover-over overlay showing the information about the band will be included in the ‘About’ section on a base of images of the band so as to provide maximum information without compromising the look of the page or having to include bulky text sections. 

-	A downloadable PDF of the Electronic Press Kit will be included on the Contact page. 

-	Forms will be used on the ‘Contact’ page to enable users to sign up to the band’s newsletter or contact the band directly. 

-	Embedded music players from the band’s Bandcamp account will be used in the individual album pages to enable users to stream the band’s music or visit Bandcamp to buy their music. 



## STRUCTURE PLANE:

The following pages will be included in the project:

-	Home

-	About

-	Music

-	Gigs

-	Contact 

Every page will feature:

-	Navbar: to easily navigate around the site without using the browser’s ‘forward’ and ‘back’ buttons.

-	Iconbar: to easily access the band’s social media pages in new tabs from any page on the site. 

-	Scotch Funeral logo displayed prominently in the nav bar as a clickable link to return to home. This will aid navigation and add recognisability to the logo because people will consistently see it. 


This same main structure will be used on every page to help the users to quickly learn how to use and navigate the site. 


**Home:**

Hero image of the band followed by cards featuring quotes/testimonials from music industry professionals about the band. 


**About:**

An image of each member of the band followed by an image of the band playing live. Each image will be overlaid on hover-over with a bio of the respective subject. 


**Music:**

A tiled style gallery of the covers of the band’s releases. On hover-over each image will show the title of the release. Both the images and the hover over content will serve as links to take the user to a page for that release where they can stream or buy (depending on availability – not all releases are still available for purchase). 


**Gigs:**

A table showing upcoming gigs. A hover effect will be used to add focus to the selected gig and links to buy tickets will be provided when appropriate. 


**Contact:**

A form for signing up to the band’s newsletter, a form enabling users to contact the band directly, email addresses for the band and their management and also a link to download the band’s EPK will be included here. 



## SKELETON PLANE

Before starting to code the website I prepared wireframes showing the planned page structures for mobile and laptop sizes on each page. 
LINK TO WIREFRAMES



## SURFACE PLANE

**Colour scheme:**

The band already works in an established monochrome colour scheme, and it was important to them that the website reflected this. 
I chose to use a light background with darker text for most of the site to make it easier to read, and included semi-transparent grey boxes as text-backgrounds to aid visibility without having blocks of flat colour. 
Where there are items which I want to further stand out (such as submit, send and buy tickets buttons) I will colour these in a muted blue to hint at the band's maritime themes and tie in with the background.


**Typography:**

I used Google Fonts to find suitable fonts for the website in order to make it stand out and to give it a more tailored and artistic feel, in line with the band’s aesthetic. I chose IM Fell English SC and Special Elite. 
IM Fell English SC was chosen as the logo font because it has a maritime and antiquated feel which lines up with the band’s aesthetic and the themes of their music, and is still visually clear and legible. 
Special Elite was chosen as it represented the more punk side of the band’s music and is similar to another font they have used elsewhere on merchandise, so it tied in and creates a visually consistent aesthetic. In some areas, a heavier weight of Special Elite will be used to draw attention to text and ensure it is clear and easily readable.

## TESTING:

**VALIDATOR SERVICES:**
- W3C Markup Validator:

- W3C CSS Validator:
- Lighthouse:


**MANUAL TESTING**

I have manually tested the site by visiting each page and methodically checking that it looks right at every size and that every feature works as intended. 

**Home** 

*Google Chrome:*

- The page looks and functions as expected when viewed in Google's Chrome browser at various sizes. 

- The Scotch Funeral logo in the navbar appears in the correct place and works as a link back to the home page. 

- The menu items in the navbar function as expected. The hamburger menu expands and retracts when it is clicked. The hover over effect colours each item into a dark grey and changes the text to white when the mouse is hovered over a menu item. 

- The links in the menu items all work. The dropdown for the 'Music' menu item displays correctly when it is clicked and retracts when clicked again.

- The same hover-over effect turning items into the opposite colour scheme also works as intended on the 'Music' dropdown. 

- The nav bar resizes appropriately and changes from a left side bar with a hamburger menu into a top nav bar with the menu items laid out horizontally at the 'medium' breakpoint as intended. 

- The social media links in the footer all work and each opens in a new tab as intended. 

- The iconbar footer changes into a vertical right side iconbar at the medium breakpoint as intended. 

- I have identified a bug where a tiny gap can sometimes be seen between the top of the right side icon bar and the bottom of the top navbar when the site is viewed on screen sizes above the medium breakpoint. This is discussed further below under 'Bugs'.

- The iconbar footer hides the basic 'Copyright' footer until the page is resized to the medium breakpoint and above and the iconbar footer moves to a vertical right side iconbar. This is intended so as not to clutter the screen on small screen sizes as the information is deemed less important than the social media links and I did not want to overwhelm the page. 

- The same hover-over effect as on the navbar is also set up on the icon bar to provide a consistent user experience and this is functioning as expected. 

- The hero image displays at the right size and in the right position and re-sizes appropriately at different screen sizes. The image is not streched or pixelated. 

- The blockquote cards showing testimonials about the band display in the correct position. They have the appropriate spacing to enable the background image to show through and make the page more visually pleasing.

The blockquote cards move from being vertically stacked to being side by side when the screen is resized to the medium breakpoint and above.


**About**
*Google Chrome:*
- All navbar, iconbar and footer functionality detailed in the above section for 'Home' is identical to that in the 'Home' page and is working correctly. 
The only difference is that 'About' is now shown in black rather than grey text to show that this is the active link. 

- The three images (Adam, Jake and band) display in the correct positions and respond as intended when the page is resized. 
The images do not appear pixelated or stretched. 

- The hover-over function looks right. It displays in the correct place and is triggered by hovering the mouse over the images as planned. It retracts correctly when the mouse moves away. 
The text on the 'about' hover-over sections is clear and easy to read. 

**Music**

*Google Chrome:*

- All navbar, iconbar and footer functionality detailed in the above section for 'Home' is identical to that in the 'Home' page and is working correctly. 
The only difference is that 'Music' is now shown in black rather than grey text to show that this is the active link. 

- The album artwork thumbnails display in the correct place with appropriate spacing between them and respond as planned when the page is resized to sit side by side in two rows of three instead of horizontally stacked. 

- The hover-over effect is consistent with that used on the 'About' page. The hover-over effect works as planned by displaying the album names and release dates overlaid over the album artwork when the mouse is hovered over it. The text is clear and legible.
The hover-over effect retracts as intended when the mouse is moved away. 

- Each album artwork thumbnail forms a clickable link which takes users to a dedicated page for that album where users can stream it. 
All the thumbnail links work and direct to the correct place. 


**Individual Album Pages**

*Google Chrome:*

Each individual album page follows an identical format for consistency. 

- 'Not Drinking' individual album page:

    - All navbar, iconbar and footer functionality detailed in the above section for 'Home' is identical to that in the 'Home' page and is working correctly. 
The only difference is that 'Music' is now shown in black rather than grey text to show that this is the active section, and on the 'Music' dropdown menu'Not Drinking' is highlighted blue to show that it is the active page. 
    - The music player displays in the correct place and remains appropriately positioned as the screen is resized. 

    - The links are showing in the correct custom blue chosen to fit with the site's colour scheme. 

    - The links function correctly and each opens in a new tab as they are external links. 

    - The music player works and the correct music is played when users click the prominent 'play' button.


- 'The Screaming Moon EP' individual album page:

    - All the same testing as for the 'Not Drinking' individual album page has been carried out with the same results.


- 'Clarity Begins At Home' individual album page:

    - All the same testing as for the 'Not Drinking' individual album page has been carried out with the same results. 


- 'Oh, Silenus!' individual album page:

    - All the same testing as for the 'Not Drinking' individual album page has been carried out with the same results. 


- 'Eating My Feet' individual album page:

    - All the same testing as for the 'Not Drinking' individual album page has been carried out with the same results. 


- 'Purgatory' individual album page:

    - All the same testing as for the 'Not Drinking' individual album page has been carried out with the same results. 

**Gigs**

*Google Chrome:*

- All navbar, iconbar and footer functionality detailed in the above section for 'Home' is identical to that in the 'Home' page and is working correctly. 
The only difference is that 'Gigs' is now shown in black rather than grey text to show that this is the active link. 

- The table is positioned as intended and is responsive, spreading out to fill the page as it is resized. 

- The table and its text are clearly legible. 

- The hover over effect changes any row which is hovered over to a light colour scheme to make it easier for users to read and focus. 
The hover over effect works as intended by turning on when the mouse hovers over a row and turning off when it moves away. 

- The 'Buy Tickets' link works and opens in a new tab. 


**Contact**

*Google Chrome:*

- All navbar, iconbar and footer functionality detailed in the above section for 'Home' is identical to that in the 'Home' page and is working correctly. 
The only difference is that 'Contact' is now shown in black rather than grey text to show that this is the active link. 

- The four boxes are positioned correctly and look balanced. 

- On resizing the screen, the boxes rearrange to line up in rows of two and the positioning remains clear and balanced. 

- The input fields tint blue when hovered over to aid usability - users will know they have clicked in the correct place before they start typing. 

- The input field for 'Message' doesn't have this hover over effect and will need to be changed. 

- The 'Submit' button for signing up to the newsletter works as a link to take users to a success page so that they know they have successfully signed up. 

- The 'Send' button for sending a message to the band works as a link to take users to a success page so that users know their message has been sent. 

- Unfortunately I haven't been able to make the success pages conditional on the forms being filled in correctly at this stage as that is currently beyond the scope of my knowledge. 

- The email addresses in the 'Contact Details' section work as 'mailto' links and open up a new email in the users email client to make it easier for them to get in touch. 

- The link to download the Electronic Press Kit as a pdf works and opens in a new tab so that users can stay on the main site. 


**Newsletter Sign Up Success**
*Google Chrome:*

- All navbar, iconbar and footer functionality detailed in the above section for 'Home' is identical to that in the 'Home' page and is working correctly, with the exception that in testing I noticed that the 'Music' link in the navbar was shown in black indicating that it was the active link when that was not the case. 
I have fixed this by removing the active link information to show that this success page is not part of the main site. 

- The cat logo and text display correctly. They also resize responsively as the screen is resized and remain centered at all screen sizes. 


**Message Sent Successfully**
*Google Chrome:*

- All navbar, iconbar and footer functionality detailed in the above section for 'Home' is identical to that in the 'Home' page and is working correctly, with the exception that in testing I noticed that the 'Music' link in the navbar was shown in black indicating that it was the active link when that was not the case. 
I have fixed this by removing the active link information to show that this success page is not part of the main site. 

- The cat logo and text display correctly. They also resize responsively as the screen is resized and remain centered at all screen sizes. 


**Bugs Identified in Manual Testing**

- I have identified a bug where there is a tiny gap between the top of the vertical right side icon bar and the bottom of the top navbar when the site is viewed on screens above the medium breakpoint size. 
This allows the background image to show through slightly and creates a faint but distracting line which disrupts the flow of the page. I have tried a number of things to fix this including adding margins and padding but this hasn't worked and the bug remains in place affecting every page. 

- The 'Message' box in the Contact the Band section of the 'Contact' page does not have the same blue hover over effect as the other input fields. I fixed this by adding the "text-input" class which was creating the effect in the other text inputs, however making the message section part of this class overrode the 'rows' which I was using to create it's height because class "text-input" had a set height.
I overrode the effect of the set height for the text-input class by adding an id of 'message' with a set height of 200px. 


**USER STORIES TESTING:**

**Existing fans of the band (A)**

Goals:
- Find out about upcoming gigs;
    - On accessing the site, existing fans can immediately see a clear navigation bar which displays a section called ‘gigs’. 
    One click to there will take them straight to a table of upcoming gigs. There is no clutter on the page distracting from the information. A hover effect has been used to add focus to the selected gig.
    All the key information including dates, venues is included. Venue information is a clickable link taking the user to the google maps location of the venue and where tickets can be bought online there is a link to buy tickets. 
    Both of these external sites are linked here and open in new tabs to prevent the user feeling they need to leave the site to go and look these things up themselves. 

- Listen to music; 
    - On accessing the site, existing fans can immediately see a clear navigation bar which displays a section called ‘music’. This is prominently displayed on every screen size and is situated in a place where the user would expect to look for it (on a traditional navigation bar).
    One click to there will take them straight to a gallery of the band’s releases to choose from. Each thumbnail displays the name and release date of that release and forms a clickable link to take the user to a page where they can either stream or buy that release.
    - I have added a dropdown to the 'Music' menu item on the navigation bar to allow fans to navigate direct to the specific album they want to listen to if they already know. This avoids cluttering up the navigation bar whilst still giving a lot of control to the user and making it easier to navigate straight to where they want to go. 

- Stay on top of the latest news from the band;
    - On every page of the site, the band's social media accounts are linked in the icon bar. The icon bar is visible at every screen size because of the importance of these links. 
    I have used Font Awesome icons for these links because they are instantly recognisable to all users and intuitive to use. Users will expect that clicking on them will take them to the band's social media sites and that is exactly what they do. 
    This allows and encourages existing fans to stay up to date with the band's news by following them on social media. 
    - There is also a 'Contact' page which takes users to a page where they can sign up for the band's newsletter to keep in touch and stay up to date with news. 
    The newsletter is the first item on the Contact page in order to make it very visible to existing and prospective fans.
    - In future, I may add a modal for signing up to the newsletter to the front page but at this time the band wanted to focus on having a clear and uncluttered hero image for a striking first impression of the site. The newsletter sign up was less important to them at this time but that may change in future and the site should adapt with their needs. 

**Potential fans of the band (B)**

Goals:
- Find out more about the band;
    - The inclusion of the hero image and the styling of the home page give a strong first impression of the band which is closely aligned to the band's aesthetic.
    The inclusion of the testimonial cards on the front page gives potential fans an idea what other people (specifically, people in the music busines) are saying about the band and adds legitimacy. 
    - An 'About' page is clearly signposted from the navigation bar which is included on every page. 
    - On accessing the 'About' page, potential fans can easily find information about the band members and the band itself, including it's history and what they sound like. 
    The information is presented in a visually pleasing and uncluttered way in order to make it easy for potential fans to engage with. 
- Listen to music;
    - Potential fans experience of listening to music on the site would be the same as that of existing fans as detailed above, as you do not need to have visited the site before in order to be able to navigate it easily. 
    The clear nav bar, additional 'music' dropdown, and individual album pages would all enable potential fans to check out the band's music easily. Having the 'music' page which shows all of the album covers increases the focus on the artwork and creates a more organic experience for users, similar to flicking through records in a bricks and mortar record shop and choosing what to try based on album covers. 
- Sign up to keep in touch. 
    - Potential fans would use the same experience as existing fans in terms of keeping in touch with the band. They can use the omnipresent social media links, or the Contact page which is also clearly signposted and accessible with only one click from any page on the site. 


**The band themselves (C)**

Goals:
The site will help the band to achieve all of their goals by being user friendly to the other users, and meeting the goals of the other users above (A, B and C) - fans, potential fans and music industry professionals. Each category of user is more likely to form a relationship with the band and go on to buy their music by having a positive experience of the band's website.
These matters will also organically support each other, for example as music industry professionals are able to access the band's information more easily, the band will gain more press coverage, which in turn will increase their fan base and help them to sell more music. 
- Increase streams of their music; 
    - The site enables any user visiting it to stream the band's music, and as detailed above this has been made as easy as possible for users to access. 
- Increase attendance at their gigs;
    - The site will increase attendance at the band's gigs by prominently displaying information about upcoming gigs. Any user visiting the site will see that there is a link to the 'gigs' section on every single page on the site. 
    Additionally, links have been included to enable users to buy tickets online in advance where that is possible. This increases the chance of site users attending gigs because they may have already committed to buying tickets - they are less likely to forget about the gig and not go. 
- Get booked for more gigs by promoters;
    - This goal will be met by the inclusion of the gig page with a table of upcoming gigs - meaning that promoters can easily see when the band is free to be booked for more gigs. The Contact page will also help to achieve this goal because promoters who want to book the band have options for two easy ways to get in touch with the band or their booking agent. 
    They can either use the contact form, or the email addresses which have been formatted as 'mailto' links so that if clicked, they will automatically open up a new email to that address in the users email client. 
    I have also added black and underline formatting to the email addresses to make set them apart from the other text and make it obvious that these are clickable links. I have also added a 'success' page which will show when a user has contacted the band to make it as user friendly as possible. This will increase users confidence in the site.  
- Increase press coverage;
    Press coverage will be increased by meeting the goals of the music industry professionals below. 
- Increase sales of music;    
    - Every page of the site includes a prominent link to the 'Music' section, as well as the 'music' dropdown which allows the user to navigate straight to the specific album they want to buy. 
    - The 'Music' page showing thumbnails of all the album artwork increases the recognisability of the album artwork, and will make it more likely that a user of the site would recognise the albums if they saw them at gigs or in a bricks and mortar shop and would increase the likelihood of them buying music. 
    - Additionally, where music is available to buy there is a link on the relevant individual album page allowing the user to do so. 
    - Unfortunately, creating a web shop as part of this site is currently beyond the scope of my knowledge and skills. This is a feature I would like to add in the future. 


**Promoters and people working in the music industry (D)**

Goals:
- Access information about the band quickly and easily (they are doing this in work, when they are likely to be busy rather than at leisure like fans);
    - Music industry professionals can easily access information about the band both in the 'About' page like other users and as detailed above and also using the Electronic Press Kit download as explained further below. 
- Listen to the band’s music; 
    - Music industry professionals can easily access and listen to the band's music in the same ways as the other users as detailed above. 
- Access photos which can be used in articles;
    - The link to download the Electronic Press Kit will really help music industry professionals with this because it includes promo images which can be used by them. 
    Music industry professionals really appreciate Electronic Press Kits, because it makes their job much easier but many bands either do not have one, or you have to contact the band and ask for it.
    By putting this up for immediate download in PDF format which is a convenient format, we are making it faster and easier for music industry professionals to get the information they need. 
- Find contact information;
    This goal is met by including a Contact page with a link to it visible on every page of the site. To aid in achieving this goal, I have included both a contact form and contact email addresses formatted as 'mailto' links.
    This means the user can use their preferred method. Some people may prefer to send an email through their own email client rather than using the webform as it may be easier for them to keep records, and music industry professionals are approaching this in their professional capacity so this may be more important to them. 
    Giving two options for getting in touch also means that if there is a problem with the web form for contacting the band, music industry professionals can still get in touch.
