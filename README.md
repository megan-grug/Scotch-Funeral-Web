## USER EXPERIENCE:

### Who will use the website?

**Existing fans of the band (A)**

Goals:
- Find out about upcoming gigs;
- Listen to music; 
- Stay on top of the latest news from the band.


**Potential fans of the band (B)**

Goals:
- Find out more about the band;
- Listen to music;
- Sign up to keep in touch. 


**The band themselves (C)**

Goals:
- Increase sales of music;
- Increase streams of their music; 
- Increase attendance at their gigs;
- Get booked for more gigs by promoters;
- Increase press coverage.


**Promoters and people working in the music industry (D)**

Goals:
- Access information about the band quickly and easily (they are doing this in work, when they are likely to be busy rather than at leisure like fans);
- Listen to the band’s music; 
- Access photos which can be used in articles;
- Find contact information. 


## STRATEGY PLANE:

**Project Purpose:**

- Increase number of gigs and attendance at gigs:
    - **Strategy:** I will do this by ensuring that information about booked gigs and details of how to buy tickets are easily available to fans visiting the site and that contact details for booking gigs are clear and visible for promoters looking to book the band for gigs. We will also use a newsletter sign up form to enable fans and potential new fans to be updated whenever new gigs are announced.

- Increase sales and streams of music:
    - **Strategy:** The website will provide a clear path to streaming and buying the band’s music. A dedicated ‘music’ page will display clear visuals of the band’s albums. The album covers will serve as links to stream or purchase the albums. Giving the album covers dedicated, uncluttered attention will enhancing recognition of the album covers, which can help with physical sales in bricks and mortar shops separately from the website. 

- Increase press coverage/radio plays:
    - **Stategy:** Ensure that Electronic Press Kit (EPK) is easily accessible direct from the website so that promoters and music industry professionals can instantly access it without having to get in touch with the band/management and wait for a response. This reduces the likelihood that they will navigate away from the site without taking action. I will ensure that direct email contact details are easy to find. Providing email addresses as well as an email/message submission form adds a back up in case of any problems using the message submission form, and may also be preferable for people getting in touch in their professional capacity as they will have a record of their sent message if they send it from their own email account. 

- Increase engagement with fans and build a sense of community:
    - **Strategy:** The band’s social media profiles will be linked to in the website and these links will be visible on every page to increase the chance of them being clicked on. They will open in new tabs to reduce the risk of fans navigating away from the site and not returning to it. We will also promote the band’s newsletter on the website to enable the band to make repeated contact with fans who opt in and develop a relationship.

NOT INCLUDED	3	2

I have chosen not to include a merchandise shop in this incarnation of the project as I do not currently have the skills to execute this feature. Furthermore, the band already benefits from a basic merch shop on Bandcamp, so this was not deemed to be a high importance feature at this time.

## SCOPE PLANE:

The website will include the following features: 

-	Navbar featuring a prominent band logo which functions as an additional link to the homepage. The navbar will be responsive and on smaller screens will move from the top of the page to the left and change to a hamburger menu. 

-	Icon-bar will serve as a footer on smaller screens and will move to be vertically aligned with the right side of the page on larger screens. This will include icons linking to the band’s social media accounts. This will ensure that the social media links are always visible without compromising the look and usability of the page and it is hoped that this will help the band to gain more followers on social media. Social media links will all open in new tabs to avoid moving people away from the site. 

-	A hero image of the band will be included on the home page to provide a striking first impression of the website and to reassure users that they are in the correct place. 

-	A hover-over overlay showing the information about the band will be included in the ‘About’ section on a base of images of the band so as to provide maximum information without compromising the look of the page or having to include bulky text sections. 

-	A downloadable PDF of the Electronic Press Kit will be included on the Contact page. 

-	Forms will be used on the ‘Contact’ page to enable users to sign up to the band’s newsletter or contact the band directly. 

-	Embedded music players from the band’s Bandcamp account will be used in the individual album pages to enable users to stream the band’s music or visit Bandcamp to buy their music. 


## STRUCTURE PLANE:

The following pages will be included in the project:

-	Home

-	About

-	Music

-	Gigs

-	Contact 

Every page will feature:

-	Navbar: to easily navigate around the site without using the browser’s ‘forward’ and ‘back’ buttons.

-	Iconbar: to easily access the band’s social media pages in new tabs from any page on the site. 

-	Scotch Funeral logo displayed prominently in the nav bar as a clickable link to return to home. This will aid navigation and add recognisability to the logo because people will consistently see it. 


This same main structure will be used on every page to help the users to quickly learn how to use and navigate the site. 

**Home:**

Hero image of the band followed by cards featuring quotes/testimonials from music industry professionals about the band. 


**About:**

An image of each member of the band followed by an image of the band playing live. Each image will be overlaid on hover-over with a bio of the respective subject. 


**Music:**

A tiled style gallery of the covers of the band’s releases. On hover-over each image will show the title of the release. Both the images and the hover over content will serve as links to take the user to a page for that release where they can stream or buy (depending on availability – not all releases are still available for purchase). 


**Gigs:**

A table showing upcoming gigs. A hover effect will be used to add focus to the selected gig and links to buy tickets will be provided when appropriate. 


**Contact:**

A form for signing up to the band’s newsletter, a form enabling users to contact the band directly, email addresses for the band and their management and also a link to download the band’s EPK will be included here. 


## SKELETON PLANE

Before starting to code the website I prepared wireframes showing the planned page structures for mobile and laptop sizes on each page.

## SURFACE PLANE

**Colour scheme:**

The band already works in an established monochrome colour scheme, and it was important to them that the website reflected this. 
I chose to use a light background with darker text for most of the site to make it easier to read, and included semi-transparent grey boxes as text-backgrounds to aid visibility without having blocks of flat colour. 


**Typography:**

I used Google Fonts to find suitable fonts for the website in order to make it stand out and to give it a more tailored and artistic feel, in line with the band’s aesthetic. I chose IM Fell English SC and Special Elite. 
IM Fell English SC was chosen as the logo font because it has a maritime and antiquated feel which lines up with the band’s aesthetic and the themes of their music, and is still visually clear and legible. 
Special Elite was chosen as it represented the more punk side of the band’s music and is similar to another font they have used elsewhere on merchandise, so it tied in and creates a visually consistent aesthetic. In some areas, a heavier weight of Special Elite will be used to draw attention to text and ensure it is clear and easily readable. 


## TECHNOLOGIES USED

-	HTML5
-	CSS3

**Frameworks, Libraries and Programs:**

## TESTING:
**VALIDATOR SERVICES:**
- W3C Markup Validator:
- W3C CSS Validator:
- Lighthouse:


**MANUAL TESTING**

I have manually tested the site by visiting each page and methodically checking that it looks right at every size and that every feature works as intended. 

**Home** 

*Google Chrome:*

- The page looks and functions as expected when viewed in Google's Chrome browser at various sizes. 
- The Scotch Funeral logo in the navbar appears in the correct place and works as a link back to the home page. 
- The menu items in the navbar function as expected. The hamburger menu expands and retracts when it is clicked. The hover over effect colours each item into a dark grey and changes the text to white when the mouse is hovered over a menu item. 
The links in the menu items all work. The dropdown for the 'Music' menu item displays correctly when it is clicked and retracts when clicked again.
The same hover-over effect turning items into the opposite colour scheme also works as intended on the 'Music' dropdown. 
- The nav bar resizes appropriately and changes from a left side bar with a hamburger menu into a top nav bar with the menu items laid out horizontally at the 'medium' breakpoint as intended. 
- The social media links in the footer all work and each opens in a new tab as intended. 
- The iconbar footer changes into a vertical right side iconbar at the medium breakpoint as intended. 
- I have identified a bug where a tiny gap can sometimes be seen between the top of the right side icon bar and the bottom of the top navbar when the site is viewed on screen sizes above the medium breakpoint. This is discussed further below under 'Bugs'.
- The iconbar footer hides the basic 'Copyright' footer until the page is resized to the medium breakpoint and above and the iconbar footer moves to a vertical right side iconbar. This is intended so as not to clutter the screen on small screen sizes as the information is deemed less important than the social media links and I did not want to overwhelm the page. 
- The same hover-over effect as on the navbar is also set up on the icon bar to provide a consistent user experience and this is functioning as expected. 
- The hero image displays at the right size and in the right position and re-sizes appropriately at different screen sizes. The image is not streched or pixelated. 
- The blockquote cards showing testimonials about the band display in the correct position. They have the appropriate spacing to enable the background image to show through and make the page more visually pleasing.
The blockquote cards move from being vertically stacked to being side by side when the screen is resized to the medium breakpoint and above.

**About**
*Google Chrome:*
- All navbar, iconbar and footer functionality detailed in the above section for 'Home' is identical to that in the 'Home' page and is working correctly. 
The only difference is that 'About' is now shown in black rather than grey text to show that this is the active link. 
- The three images (Adam, Jake and band) display in the correct positions and respond as intended when the page is resized. 
The images do not appear pixelated or stretched. 
The hover-over function looks right. It displays in the correct place and is triggered by hovering the mouse over the images as planned. It retracts correctly when the mouse moves away. 
The text on the 'about' hover-over sections is clear and easy to read. 

**Music**

*Google Chrome:*

- All navbar, iconbar and footer functionality detailed in the above section for 'Home' is identical to that in the 'Home' page and is working correctly. 
The only difference is that 'Music' is now shown in black rather than grey text to show that this is the active link. 
- The album artwork thumbnails display in the correct place with appropriate spacing between them and respond as planned when the page is resized to sit side by side in two rows of three instead of horizontally stacked. 
- The hover-over effect is consistent with that used on the 'About' page. The hover-over effect works as planned by displaying the album names and release dates overlaid over the album artwork when the mouse is hovered over it. The text is clear and legible.
The hover-over effect retracts as intended when the mouse is moved away. 
- Each album artwork thumbnail forms a clickable link which takes users to a dedicated page for that album where users can stream it. 
All the thumbnail links work and direct to the correct place. 

**Individual Album Pages**

*Google Chrome:*

Each individual album page follows an identical format for consistency. 
- 'Not Drinking' individual album page:
    - All navbar, iconbar and footer functionality detailed in the above section for 'Home' is identical to that in the 'Home' page and is working correctly. 
The only difference is that 'Music' is now shown in black rather than grey text to show that this is the active section, and on the 'Music' dropdown menu'Not Drinking' is highlighted blue to show that it is the active page. 
    - The music player displays in the correct place and remains appropriately positioned as the screen is resized. 
    - The links are showing in the correct custom blue chosen to fit with the site's colour scheme. 
    - The links function correctly and each opens in a new tab as they are external links. 
    - The music player works and the correct music is played when users click the prominent 'play' button.
- 'The Screaming Moon EP' individual album page:
    - All the same testing as for the 'Not Drinking' individual album page has been carried out with the same results.
- 'Clarity Begins At Home' individual album page:
    - All the same testing as for the 'Not Drinking' individual album page has been carried out with the same results. 
- 'Oh, Silenus!' individual album page:
    - All the same testing as for the 'Not Drinking' individual album page has been carried out with the same results. 
- 'Eating My Feet' individual album page:
    - All the same testing as for the 'Not Drinking' individual album page has been carried out with the same results. 
- 'Purgatory' individual album page:
    - All the same testing as for the 'Not Drinking' individual album page has been carried out with the same results. 

**Gigs**
*Google Chrome:*
- All navbar, iconbar and footer functionality detailed in the above section for 'Home' is identical to that in the 'Home' page and is working correctly. 
The only difference is that 'Gigs' is now shown in black rather than grey text to show that this is the active link. 
- The table is positioned as intended and is responsive, spreading out to fill the page as it is resized. 
- The table and its text are clearly legible. 
- The hover over effect changes any row which is hovered over to a light colour scheme to make it easier for users to read and focus. 
The hover over effect works as intended by turning on when the mouse hovers over a row and turning off when it moves away. 
- The 'Buy Tickets' link works and opens in a new tab. 

**Contact**
*Google Chrome:*
- All navbar, iconbar and footer functionality detailed in the above section for 'Home' is identical to that in the 'Home' page and is working correctly. 
The only difference is that 'Contact' is now shown in black rather than grey text to show that this is the active link. 
- The four boxes are positioned correctly and look balanced. 
- On resizing the screen, the boxes rearrange to line up in rows of two and the positioning remains clear and balanced. 
- The input fields tint blue when hovered over to aid usability - users will know they have clicked in the correct place before they start typing. 
- The input field for 'Message' doesn't have this hover over effect and will need to be changed. 
- The 'Submit' button for signing up to the newsletter works as a link to take users to a success page so that they know they have successfully signed up. 
- The 'Send' button for sending a message to the band works as a link to take users to a success page so that users know their message has been sent. 
- Unfortunately I haven't been able to make the success pages conditional on the forms being filled in correctly at this stage as that is currently beyond the scope of my knowledge. 
- The email addresses in the 'Contact Details' section work as 'mailto' links and open up a new email in the users email client to make it easier for them to get in touch. 
- The link to download the Electronic Press Kit as a pdf works and opens in a new tab so that users can stay on the main site. 

**Newsletter Sign Up Success**
*Google Chrome:*
- All navbar, iconbar and footer functionality detailed in the above section for 'Home' is identical to that in the 'Home' page and is working correctly, with the exception that in testing I noticed that the 'Music' link in the navbar was shown in black indicating that it was the active link when that was not the case. 
I have fixed this by removing the active link information to show that this success page is not part of the main site. 
- The cat logo and text display correctly. They also resize responsively as the screen is resized and remain centered at all screen sizes. 

**Message Sent Successfully**

**Bugs Identified in Manual Testing**
- I have identified a bug where there is a tiny gap between the top of the vertical right side icon bar and the bottom of the top navbar when the site is viewed on screens above the medium breakpoint size. 
This allows the background image to show through slightly and creates a faint but distracting line which disrupts the flow of the page. I have tried a number of things to fix this including adding margins and padding but this hasn't worked and the bug remains in place affecting every page. 
- The 'Message' box in the Contact the Band section of the 'Contact' page does not have the same blue hover over effect as the other input fields. I fixed this by adding the "text-input" class which was creating the effect in the other text inputs, however making the message section part of this class overrode the 'rows' which I was using to create it's height because class "text-input" had a set height.
I overrode the effect of the set height for the text-input class by adding an id of 'message' with a set height of 200px.
