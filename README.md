## STRATEGY PLANE:
Project Purpose:
•	Increase number of gigs and attendance at gigs:
o	We will do this by ensuring that information about booked gigs and details of how to buy tickets are easily available to fans visiting the site and that contact details for booking gigs are clear and visible for promoters looking to book the band for gigs. We will also use a newsletter sign up form to enable fans and potential new fans to be updated whenever new gigs are announced.

•	Increase sales and streams of music:
o	The website will provide a clear path to streaming and buying the band’s music. A dedicated ‘music’ page will display clear visuals of the band’s albums. The album covers will serve as links to stream or purchase the albums. Giving the album covers dedicated, uncluttered attention will enhancing recognition of the album covers, which can help with physical sales in bricks and mortar shops separately from the website. 

•	Increase press coverage/radio plays:
o	Ensure that Electronic Press Kit (EPK) is easily accessible direct from the website so that promoters and music industry professionals can instantly access it without having to get in touch with the band/management and wait for a response. This reduces the likelihood that they will navigate away from the site without taking action. I will ensure that direct email contact details are easy to find. Providing email addresses as well as an email/message submission form adds a back up in case of any problems using the message submission form, and may also be preferable for people getting in touch in their professional capacity as they will have a record of their sent message if they send it from their own email account. 

•	Increase engagement with fans and build a sense of community:
o	The band’s social media profiles will be linked to in the website and these links will be visible on every page to increase the chance of them being clicked on. They will open in new tabs to reduce the risk of fans navigating away from the site and not returning to it. We will also promote the band’s newsletter on the website to enable the band to make repeated contact with fans who opt in and develop a relationship.

Merch shop
NOT INCLUDED	3	2

I have chosen not to include a merchandise shop in this incarnation of the project as I do not currently have the skills to execute this feature. Furthermore, the band already benefits from a basic merch shop on Bandcamp, so this was not deemed to be a high importance feature at this time.

## SCOPE PLANE:
The website will include the following features: 
-	Navbar featuring a prominent band logo which functions as an additional link to the homepage. The navbar will be responsive and on smaller screens will move from the top of the page to the left and change to a hamburger menu. 
-	Icon-bar will serve as a footer on smaller screens and will move to be vertically aligned with the right side of the page on larger screens. This will include icons linking to the band’s social media accounts. This will ensure that the social media links are always visible without compromising the look and usability of the page and it is hoped that this will help the band to gain more followers on social media. Social media links will all open in new tabs to avoid moving people away from the site. 
-	A hero image of the band will be included on the home page to provide a striking first impression of the website and to reassure users that they are in the correct place. 
-	A hover-over overlay showing the information about the band will be included in the ‘About’ section on a base of images of the band so as to provide maximum information without compromising the look of the page or having to include bulky text sections. 
-	A downloadable PDF of the Electronic Press Kit will be included on the Contact page. 
-	Forms will be used on the ‘Contact’ page to enable users to sign up to the band’s newsletter or contact the band directly. 
-	Embedded music players from the band’s Bandcamp account will be used in the individual album pages to enable users to stream the band’s music or visit Bandcamp to buy their music. 


## STRUCTURE PLANE:
-	Home
-	About
-	Music
-	Gigs
-	Contact 

Every page will feature:
-	Navbar: to easily navigate around the site without using the browser’s ‘forward’ and ‘back’ buttons.
-	Iconbar: to easily access the band’s social media pages in new tabs from any page on the site. 
-	Scotch Funeral logo displayed prominently in the nav bar as a clickable link to return to home. This will aid navigation and add recognisability to the logo because people will consistently see it. 

This same main structure will be used on every page to help the users to quickly learn how to use and navigate the site. 
Home:
Hero image of the band followed by cards featuring quotes/testimonials from music industry professionals about the band. 
About:
An image of each member of the band followed by an image of the band playing live. Each image will be overlaid on hover-over with a bio of the respective subject. 
Music:
A tiled style gallery of the covers of the band’s releases. On hover-over each image will show the title of the release. Both the images and the hover over content will serve as links to take the user to a page for that release where they can stream or buy (depending on availability – not all releases are still available for purchase). 
Gigs:
A table showing upcoming gigs. A hover effect will be used to add focus to the selected gig and links to buy tickets will be provided when appropriate. 
Contact:
A form for signing up to the band’s newsletter, a form enabling users to contact the band directly, email addresses for the band and their management and also a link to download the band’s EPK will be included here. 


## SKELETON PLANE
Before starting to code the website I prepared wireframes showing the planned page structures for mobile and laptop sizes on each page. 


## SURFACE PLANE
Colour scheme:
The band already works in an established monochrome colour scheme, and it was important to them that the website reflected this. 
I chose to use a light background with darker text for most of the site to make it easier to read, and included semi-transparent grey boxes as text-backgrounds to aid visibility without having blocks of flat colour. 
Typography:
I used Google Fonts to find suitable fonts for the website in order to make it stand out and to give it a more tailored and artistic feel, in line with the band’s aesthetic. I chose IM Fell English SC and Special Elite. 
IM Fell English SC was chosen as the logo font because it has a maritime and antiquated feel which lines up with the band’s aesthetic and the themes of their music, and is still visually clear and legible. 
Special Elite was chosen as it represented the more punk side of the band’s music and is similar to another font they have used elsewhere on merchandise, so it tied in and creates a visually consistent aesthetic. In some areas, a heavier weight of Special Elite will be used to draw attention to text and ensure it is clear and easily readable.
